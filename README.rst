===============================

This repository contains a copy of the US English STRAIGHT-based
`HTS demo <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/?Download>`_.
The HTS demos are designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the
`HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/>`_ for
statistical parametric speech synthesis.

Please note that this repository is an unofficial copy of the US English
STRAIGHT-based HTS demo and is not endorsed in any way by the HTS working group
who maintains the HTS demos.
Accordingly any questions or bug reports should be directed to the HTS working
group using the contact details given below.

Overview
--------

Starting from a corpus of text data and speech audio data from a human speaker,
this software trains a statistical parametric speech synthesis system designed to
imitate that speaker.
This trained system can then be used to synthesize speech audio for new pieces
of text data.

The text data should be provided in the form of utterance files generated by
`Festival <http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>`_ rather than raw text.
These utterance files should use the same phoneme set used by the
`CMU Pronouncing Dictionary <http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict>`_.
The speech data should be provided in the form of raw 16 kHz 16-bit audio files,
which are essentially just wav files with the header information removed.

Modifications from the official version
---------------------------------------

This repository contains some minor modifications from the official version of the
US English STRAIGHT-based `HTS demo <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/?Download>`_:

- it adds this README file
- it adds the ``License`` file
- it removes the ``configure`` script since a suitable script can be automatically
  generated from the provided ``configure.ac`` file using ``autoconf``.
  This follows standard version control practices.
- it removes ``scripts/.cvsignore`` and ``data/.cvsignore``

Installation
------------

The source code is hosted in the
`hts-demo-straight-en-US-cmudict github repository <https://github.com/MattShannon/hts-demo-straight-en-US-cmudict>`_.
To obtain the latest source code using git::

    git clone git://github.com/MattShannon/hts-demo-straight-en-US-cmudict.git

hts-demo-straight-en-US-cmudict depends on the following software packages:

- `Festival <http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>`_
  (for the ``dumpfeats`` script)
- `Speech Processing Toolkit (SPTK) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/sp-tk/>`_
- `HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/>`_
- `hts_engine API <http://hts-engine.sourceforge.net/>`_
  (if synthesis using HTS engine rather than HTS's HMGenS tool is desired)
- `STRAIGHT vocoder <http://www.wakayama-u.ac.jp/~kawahara/STRAIGHTadv/index_e.html>`_
- `MATLAB <www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_ (to run the STRAIGHT vocoder)

The versions of these software packages required can be found in ``INSTALL``.

To set-up this directory:

- generate the ``configure`` script from ``configure.ac`` using ``autoconf``
- follow the instructions for the official version included in ``INSTALL``
